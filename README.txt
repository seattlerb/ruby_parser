== DESCRIPTION:

ruby_parser (RP) is a ruby parser written in pure ruby (utilizing
racc--which does by default use a C extension). RP's output is
the same as ParseTree's output: s-expressions using ruby's arrays and
base types.

As an example:

  def conditional1(arg1)
    if arg1 == 0 then
      return 1
    end
    return 0
  end

becomes:

  s(:defn, :conditional1,
   s(:args, :arg1),
   s(:scope,
    s(:block,
     s(:if,
      s(:call, s(:lvar, :arg1), :==, s(:arglist, s(:lit, 0))),
      s(:return, s(:lit, 1)),
      nil),
     s(:return, s(:lit, 0)))))

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Pure ruby, no compiles.
* Includes preceding comment data for defn/defs/class/module nodes!
* Incredibly simple interface.
* Output is 100% equivalent to ParseTree.
  * Can utilize PT's SexpProcessor and UnifiedRuby for language processing.
* Known Issue: Speed is now pretty good, but can always improve:
  * RP parses a corpus of 3702 files in 125s (avg 108 Kb/s)
  * MRI+PT parsed the same in 67.38s (avg 200.89 Kb/s)
* Known Issue: Code is much better, but still has a long way to go.
* Known Issue: Totally awesome.
* Known Issue: line number values can be slightly off. Parsing LR sucks.

== SYNOPSIS:

  RubyParser.new.parse "1+1"
  # => s(:call, s(:lit, 1), :+, s(:array, s(:lit, 1)))

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ruby. woot.
* sexp_processor for Sexp and SexpProcessor classes.
* ParseTree for testing.
* racc full package for parser development (compiling .y to .rb).

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install ruby_parser
